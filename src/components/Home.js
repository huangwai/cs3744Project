            Hello, my name is Jimmy Huynh,
            I am a rising senior majoring in Computer Science at Virginia Tech.
            This semester I’m currently taking courses on Computer Systems, Data Algorithms,
            developing my own application in SWE Capstone.
            I’ve completed projects related to mobile application development, created and utilized
            various data structures like Linked Lists and Stacks,
            and I’ve collaborated on many team projects from past semesters. I’m proficient in
            Javascript, java Python, Kotlin, C, and Git.
            I hope to utilize and further advance my skills in problem-solving and communications
            to perform more diligently in the future.
        </p>
