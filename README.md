Jimmy Huynh CS 3744 Final Project
Huzzah

Description:
For your final project, you are going to create your own personal website and host it online with Heroku.

If you already have a website, you still need to create the following instruction inside React and deploy it using Heroku through the GitHub repository.

Your personal website includes a Home/About page and Projects page, which has navigation to your homework assignments.

The home page contains information about yourself. What you include on this page is up to you but at minimum, provide some information about yourself, a picture (in case you don't want to submit a photo, provide an image placeholder), and your skillsets. Be creative about how you are presenting yourself; this is your website.

The Projects page will provide information about all your homework. Each homework description will be contained inside the project component with a small image and a short description. When the user clicks on each of these descriptions, they will be navigated to that homework page.

The overall style between pages should be consistent, which means the look of your website should not massively change from one navigation to another unless it is intentional for design purposes and needs to be justified.

The navigation for the website will be as follow:

"/": Home page

"/projects":  Projects page that describes your homework assignments.

"/projects/1": NASA homework

"/projects/2": Grid layout

"/projects/3": P5

"/projects/4": D3

"*": (For all other URL) Home page

You need to provide a navigation bar containing your home and projects tab, either on the side or at the top of the page, that is accessible on all pages, so users can easily navigate to the home or projects page at any time while visiting your page.

Your final project needs to look like a modern website (production-ready). This means it is better to use the pre-built component library in your project, such as Material UI, to make sure design perspectives for implementation and User Experience (UX) are followed.

You are allowed to use any online library that is publicly available and is open-source. Any commercial library is not permitted.

Material related to how to use react-router, setting up your project inside Heroku, and understanding Git will be provided during class time.

For your final project, you need to create an account for both Heroku and Github.



For those who seek challenge, I salute thee!

Instead of providing the lame grid layout for homework 2, I highly encourage you to challenge yourself and change it to a functional calculator and provide simple arithmetic! (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) You are going to learn a ton going through this.



Grading:
Quality:
Having a responsive layout (20 points)
Consistency between pages, in case missing, needs to be justified (10 points)
Functional navigation bar (10 points each)
File Structure: Your source code needs to follow file structure. For example, all components need to be placed in a component directory, styles placed in css folder, etc. (10 points)
Routing: The URL navigation should be functional. (10 points)
Heroku deployment: Your project should be up and running with the URL that you provide (20 points)
Gitup repository: Providing only necessary files and ignoring unnecessary files (10 points)
Code readability: Decided during grading (10 points)


Submission:
Submit a link to your Github repository and a link to your up-and-running application on Heroku.
